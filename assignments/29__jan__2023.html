        <p>Create an HTML file (e.g. first_page.html) that specifies a page that contains a heading and two
            paragraphs of text. </p>

        <p>Use the HTML tags
        <h1>, </h1>, <p> and </p> in this exercise. As the texts in the
        heading and paragraphs you can use any texts you like.</p>

         Add an unordered list to this web page. An unordered list should look like the following when
        it is shown by a browser:
         An unordered list can be specified with the tags <ul> and </ul>.
         An unordered list typically contains a number of list items that can be specified
        with tags <li> and </li>.
         After you have created your unordered list, check out what happens when you
        convert it to an ordered list by replacing the tags <ul> and </ul> with <ol> and
        </ol>, respectively.
         Add an image to your web page. In this exercise you must use the <img> tag. As an image, you
        can use any .jpg or .png file you find on the Internet.
